# Cockpit

The Cockpit module contains the frontend and backend.

## Running locally

If you have a local setup as specified in the projects [README](../README.md), you can run the cockpit by:

1. Starting any other top-level modules you wish to run, e.g. [`HyriseInterface`](../hyrise_interface/) or [`WorkloadGenerator`](../workload_generator/) by following their respective instructions.
2. Start the [`Backend`](../backend/).
3. Start the [`Frontend`](../frontend/).
